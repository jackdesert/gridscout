# mgrs-search
A console-based MGRS search tool

This interactive Python script searches for places by using Google's "Places API". It displays the results as a list of up to 60 places with MGRS coordinates. In this way, it helps the user perform map-based data collection in a way that is easy to communicate, and also to annotate on physical overlays of maps which use the Military Grid Reference System.
